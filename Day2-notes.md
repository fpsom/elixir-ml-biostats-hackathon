    - what to do and what not to do
2. know the measures for ML model evaluation
3. feature engineering, visualization (raw data / models)
4. execute the appropriate software packages/libraries to apply a ML pipeline to a given dataset
5. more confidence in their data (understand their data) and research output


## Episodes

### Episode 1: **Introduction to Machine Learning**

_Learning Outcomes_

9. Explain the difference between structured vs. unstructured data
    - This should be part of 1st point :+1: 


We should be able to think of an exercise that addresses one or more of the LO. If there is no such exercise, we should re-assess the LO. :+1:

Have an over-arching theme / context: e.g. based on an RNA-Seq dataset, create a classification / clustering model?

2. Explain and critically argue about the criteria for evaluating an ML model
    - _Internal Note_: Referring to F-measure, accuracy, recall, specificity, sensitivity, silhouette, confusion matrix, etc
3. Evaluate and compare ML models for a particular dataset;  what could you do to improve your model ?
    - _Internal Note_: Referring to training, testing, validation/cross-validation, dangers of overfitting/underfitting
:+1: 

### Episode 3: **Optimizing a model**

_Learning Outcomes_ :+1: :+1: 
1. Choose one or more appropriate ML methods (taught in the course) for the research question / dataset in question
2. For each appropriate ML method A, identify the optimal parameter set (hyperparameter optimization)
    - _Internal Note_: Also define what is hyperparameter optimization
3. Demonstrate the understanding of assumptions pertaining to the associated model of method A, its applicability to data
    - (including how to decide on the number of clusters)
4. Grasp the issue of bias and variance in ML and how ML design choices influence this balance
    - under/over-fitting. can be solved with regularization (GLM,LM), by tuning alogrithm parameters (tree depth, k in KNN)
    - dropout
    - cross-validation
5. Explain the problem of data imbalance and how to solve it properly
    - oversampling (when we have a few data)
    - undersampling (when we have enough data)

### Episode 4: **Selecting the features** :+1:

### Exercises


#### Group #1

Episode: ### Episode 2: **Components and Evaluation of a Machine Learning Pipeline**
Participants: Pedro, Anmol, Khaled, Gasper

[comment] Before Exercise #1 have:
- Illustrated example of building an ML model
- 

Exercise #1: Please, re-order the following steps in the correct way (addressing LO1)

Question: Reorder followings steps for Machine Learning model creation.
- Model performance evaluation using test datase based on Cross-validation, F-Measure, accuracy, recall, specificity, sensitivity etc
- Data QC and Preprocessing(Visualisation, Imputation,Transformation (categorical to numerical),Normalisation)
- Various model development using training sets
- Training and testing data separation
- Model optimisations
- Acquiring a dataset
- Model deployment for real world data




[comment] Before Exercise #2 have:
- 

Exercise #2: If you have generated 3 models from your data, and you want to decide which model to use. #Calculate the confusion matrix for all models and pick the one with the better performance:

Model 1   Model 2    Model 3
50 | 50   60 | 68    40 | 30       TP | FN
50 | 50   32 | 40    70 | 60       FP | TN




[Hint ]

Confusion Matrix

|  | Yes   | No |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Yes     | a    | b     |
| No     | c     | d     |


Offer multiple models, each with their confusion matrix and the accuracy score, and rank them from best to worst.

#### Group #3

Episode 4: **Selecting the features**

Participants: 
- Claudio Mirabello
- Van Du Tran
- Shakuntala Baichoo


_Learning Outcomes_
1. Identify the need for feature selection
2. Apply feature selection to choose optimal features
3. Define different methods for data preprocessing, and apply them to the given dataset.
    - _Internal Note_: Data Imputation, Data Normalisation and Data Restructuring 



Before Exercise #1 have:
- Introduce/load the dataset that will be used throughout this episode
- Show the data in tables to do some exploration (that type of data? Is it complete? Are there NAs? Are they count? Are there categorical variables?)
    - Show the data visually through plotting (scatterplots, etc)
- Show the "outcome" column (labels), which value means sick/healthy? How many classes are there?
- Show if there is a class imbalance between outcomes
- Train a classifier on the dataset as it is

Exercise #1
- [outcome 3] Given the dataset shown before in exercise #1 (e.g. metagenomics) where:
    - Some features are not present (NA) in some of the samples
    - What to do for samples where some features are missing?
        - Try removing such samples/features altogether
        - Try imputing features by replacing NA with mean or median for that feature (dataset-wise)
        - Try using k-NN to find most similar samples and using features from those samples
        - How do these approaches compare? Which is best?

Before Exercise #2 have:
- Explain why some ML methods are sensitive to input/output scaling
- Code showing how different types of normalization/rescaling can be performed

Exercise #2
- [outcome 3] Given the same dataset where the features are counts (from 0 to a high integer):
    - Try to apply different methods for data scaling (Z-score, min-max) to the data
    - Try to visualize the data again in plots, what has changed? What looks the same?
    - Try to train again the predictor on the re-scaled data, does this improve the performance? Why do you think that is?

Before Exercise #3 have:
- Explain/refresh difference between categorical and numerical features
- Load clinical dataset (addition to previously introduced dataset)
- Show that the dataset have the same number of samples, but different types of features (categorical)
- Show how to convert categorical features to one-hot encoding or to perform other relevant types of encoding

[Outcome 3] Exercise #3
- Given an additional part of the dataset including clinical features:
    - Some other clinical features are present that are categorical (i.e. sex, smoker or not etc.)
    - How to include clinical features in the dataset?
        - Try encoding categorical variables in different ways (ordinal, one-hot)
        - Do clinical features help with the predction? 
        - Which encoding works best?

[comment] Before Exercise #4 have:
- Show how to calculate or plot/visualize pairwise correlation of features
- Show how to perform a PCA (or other kind of dimensionality reduction) plot features and/or samples to see how they group, give an idea of how many features might be informative in the end

- [Outcome 1 & 2] Exercise #4 (fleshed out)
    - Prepare a dataset where some features are highly correlated, others have very low variance. In general, a small subset of features should be enough to perform a classification task (e.g. a metagenomics dataset where the presence of a handful of bacteria species is enough to predict some kind of illness)
    - Test a classifier that has been covered beforehand (e.g. SVM etc) on the full dataset (no features removed), evaluate the performance (at this stage the performance should not be great)
    - Perform all-against-all correlation of features and plot them in appropriate ways, find out which features are very correlated
    - Remove a subset of features that have been found to be highly correlated
    - Test again the same classifier and see what kind of impact removing the features had on the performance
    - Select an even smaller set of features based on variance
    - Test again as previously done
    - Select an even smaller set of features based on feature importance as calculated by e.g. Random Forest
    - Test again the classifier on this set of features, find out which subset of features gives the best performance

The credentials for the e-learning platform that hosts the survey were emailed to you on October 13.

**ToDo**: Define the ideal profile of an Instructor for this course (re abilities, experiences, etc). Pairing Instructors to address this.

What need to be said before each exercise.
