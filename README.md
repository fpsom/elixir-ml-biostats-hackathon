## Timeline


| Time | Scope |
|------|-------|
| Before day #1 of Hackathon | Setup GitHub repo: <br /> - CC-BY license <br/> - Lesson to be published in zenodo <br/> - Leads as "lesson" editors <br/> - All contributors as co-authors <br/><br/> Lesson Preparation: <br/> - Collate material from similar/relevant events <br/> - Provide examples of Learning Objectives, Learning Outcomes and Learning Profiles <br/><br/> Outreach & Engagement: <br/> - Date to be communicated to the ELIXIR Training Coordinators mailing list, the ELIXIR Machine Learning Focus Group mailing list, H3ABioNet, etc |
|  **Day #1 of Hackathon**   | Goals are: <br/> - Specify learners’ profiles (i.e. target audience) <br/> - Specify Learning objectives and, <br/> - Specify Learning outcomes <br/> Near the end of the day, decide on the date of Day #2  |
| Before day #2 of Hackaton | - Reformat / Restructure all notes <br/> - Create a skeleton structure of the material (pending approval) |
|  **Day #2 of Hackathon** | Goals are: <br/> - confirm structure and flow of the content <br/> - Sprepare the first set of hands-on exercises that target specific learning outcomes (one or more) <br/> - Identify potential timeline for final release |

## Existing material

_@all: feel free to add related content you are already aware of here:_

_content should be open (i.e. under CC license), and practical (i.e. hands-on exercises, rather than slides)_

1. [SIB "Introduction to Machine Learning" course](https://fpsom.github.io/2020-07-machine-learning-sib/)
  - **Notes**: Practical ML using R. Introductory level. Requires programming knowledge in R (`dplyr, tidyverse`). Covers Exploratory Data Analysis, k-means, hierarchical clustering, decision trees, random forests, linear regression, glm


2. [BC2 Introduction to Machine Learning](https://fpsom.github.io/IntroToMachineLearning/)
  - **Notes**: Practical ML using R. Introductory level. Requires programming knowledge in R (`dplyr, tidyverse`). Covers Exploratory Data Analysis, k-means, hierarchical clustering, decision trees, random forests, linear regression, glm

3. [Galaxy Training Material on Statistics and machine learning](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/statistics/)
  - **Notes**: Practical ML using Galaxy. Covers a wide range of topics (Supervised, Unsupervised, Regression, Classification, Deep Learning). Does not offer any coding aspects.

4. [Cambridge Coding Academy GitHub repo](https://github.com/cambridgecoding)  ([Cambridge Coding Academy website](https://cambridgecoding.com/))
  - **Notes**:

5. [Cambridge bioinformatics training GitHub repo](https://github.com/cambiotraining)  ([Cambridge Coding Academy website](http://cambiotraining.github.io/))
  - **Notes**: Contains various relevant courses that can be re-used / adapted [Course materials for An Introduction to Machine Learning 2019](https://bioinformatics-training.github.io/intro-machine-learning-2019/), [Basic statistics and data handling](https://github.com/cambiotraining/stats-intro)

6. [NBIS Workshop in Biostatistics and Machine Learning](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-mlbiostatistics/)
  - **Notes**: Contains the teaching material (lectures/tutorials/labs) for the different course sessions, see [link to course info and schedule](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-mlbiostatistics/) for how these sessions are structured in the course. This workshop will be given in November 2020 and material above is in the process of being updated from the 2019 workshop and reformatted into a common format, in other words *Work in progress*. 

7. [NBIS Workshop in Omics Integration](https://github.com/NBISweden/workshop_omics_integration)
  - **Notes**: Contains the teaching material (lectures/tutorials/labs) for the different course sessions, see [link to course info and schedule](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop_omics_integration/) for how these sessions are structured in the course. This workshop is currently being given (October 2020) and material above is still being updated, in other words *Work in progress*
