## Curriculum Development

Reverse Instructional Design
- based on research summarised in The Carpentries Instructor Training
- determine target audience
- determine practical skill(s) they need to learn
- create concept maps to guide curriculum design
- design exercises to assess learner progress towards objectives*
- write connecting material*

_* I don't expect us to reach this point during day #1_


## Learner's Profiles

To teach effectively, you have to know who you are teaching. Your audience can be identified in many ways. Frequently people who are hosting a workshop have a specific audience in mind, based on their own experience.

One "creative" way to think deeply about the audience for a workshop is to take a few moments to write _learner profiles_. Learner profiles have three parts: the person’s general background, the problem they face, and how the course will help them. One example of a learner profile for a Software Carpentry workshop might be:

**Learner Profile Example** (_copied from the [The Carpentries Instructor Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/)_)

> João is an agricultural engineer doing his masters in soil physics. His programming experience is a first year programming course using C. He was never able to use this low-level programming in his activities, and never programmed after the first year.
> 
> His work consists of evaluating physical properties of soil samples from different conditions. Some of the soil properties are measured by an automated device that sends logs in a text format to his machine. João has to open each file in Excel, crop the first and last quarters of data values, and calculate an average.
> 
> Software Carpentry will show João how to write shell scripts to count the lines and crop the right range for each file, and how to use R to read these files and calculate the required statistics. It will also show him how to put his programs and files under version control so that he can re-run analyses and figure out which results may have been affected by changes.


## What Are The Learning Objectives?

Once you have an idea of your intended audience, the next step is to think through the goals for your workshop. These goals are usually communicated through _learning objectives_. We need to be realistic about what audience can learn in the time available (1-2 days). Having specific objectives helps avoid creep in lesson scope. Bloom's Taxonomy can help with this:

_"By the end of the [lesson|section], learners will be able to..."_

### Concept Maps

Our tool of choice for representing someone’s mental model is a concept map, in which facts are bubbles and connections are labeled connections.

## Learning Outcomes

**Objectives vs. Outcomes**

> A learning objective is what a lesson strives to achieve. A learning outcome is what it actually achieves, i.e. what learners actually take away. The role of summative assessment is therefore to compare learning outcomes with learning objectives.
