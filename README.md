## Timeline


| Time | Scope |
|------|-------|
| Before day #1 of Hackathon | Setup GitHub repo: <br /> - CC-BY license <br/> - Lesson to be published in zenodo <br/> - Leads as "lesson" editors <br/> - All contributors as co-authors <br/><br/> Lesson Preparation: <br/> - Collate material from similar/relevant events <br/> - Provide examples of Learning Objectives, Learning Outcomes and Learning Profiles <br/><br/> Outreach & Engagement: <br/> - Date to be communicated to the ELIXIR Training Coordinators mailing list, the ELIXIR Machine Learning Focus Group mailing list, H3ABioNet, etc |
|  **Day #1 of Hackathon**   | Goals are: <br/> - Specify learnersâ€™ profiles (i.e. target audience) <br/> - Specify Learning objectives and, <br/> - Specify Learning outcomes <br/> Near the end of the day, decide on the date of Day #2  |
| Before day #2 of Hackaton | - Reformat / Restructure all notes <br/> - Create a skeleton structure of the material (pending approval) |
|  **Day #2 of Hackathon** | Goals are: <br/> - confirm structure and flow of the content <br/> - Sprepare the first set of hands-on exercises that target specific learning outcomes (one or more) <br/> - Identify potential timeline for final release |
